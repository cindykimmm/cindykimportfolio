      <p>
      Transfer your drawings into the p5 sketch. Plug the maximum / minimum values into random() for each of the attributes. Make sure that you include the following technical components in your sketch:User-defined variables random() mouseX and mouseY, mousePressed() or keyPressed() Closely observe how the attributes relate to one another in every variation, and refine the parameters until every variation feels intentional.

      <p>
        Through this assignment, I was able to learn about User-defined variables random() mouseX and mouseY, mousePressed() and keyPressed(). My sketch was to create a circle shaped cartoon-like human face and have randomized color, size of the eyes and mouth and size of the head. While working on this, I have a happy accident with mousePressed() function with having random background colors on mouse pressed. When I added this function, it changed the randomized funcion of the color of the head to remain whenever the size of the head is changing. I found it super fun and decided to leave it this way.
