      <p>
      Design and code an experimental clock that expresses a novel way of tracking time. Conventional clocks mark seconds, minutes, and hours according to a 24 hour cycle. This segmented, discrete, and regimented approach to parsing time is not universal in terms of capturing and measuring of experience. In this assignment you are tasked with developing an experimental clock. This clock can function in ways that ordinary clocks cannot. In order to complete this assignment you are invited to think of time expansively and alternatively, moving beyond conventional time keeping units. What are other ways in which you can mark the passage of time? What if time itself were turned on its head, driven not by standard time-keeping units, but perhaps subjective, personal, or even irrational organization?
