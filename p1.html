       This is a drawing I made using shape primitives with p5.

        It was a really fun learning experience to recreate a shape that I easily made on a sketch board by only using coding. It still felt a little difficult for me to capture all the details and the exact numbers of rectangles but I tried to create an outline of the shape as accurate as possible. Through this experience, I learned how to add colors and different shapes using P5JS.
